# ACWebServicesIntegration
This repository contains code that I use to demonstrate and experiment with integrating with Agile Central using Web Services API

Demo notes:

Use mvn tomcat7:deploy or tomcat7:undeploy to deploy the package to a local tomcat server running on port 8080
Remember to add the server definition in %MAVEN_HOME%/conf/settings.xml file
